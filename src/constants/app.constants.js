        CONTENT: `ZerpCraft has teamed up with the professional building group Elite Realism to make the first ZerpCraft NFT a very special minting. 
            
            They have created “Castle ZerpCraft”, a custom castle, that will available for Auction the day of launch (March 19th). The auction will last through Sunday the 20th. Minimum bid will start at $250. The auction code is setup to confirm that players actually possess the required amount of XRP in their XUMM wallets in order to place bids. Simply log into the ZerpCraft server, register your wallet, and make sure your wallet has enough XRP to cover your current bid! Most likely there will be a Twitch stream along with the auction, but you’ll need to be logged into the ZerpCraft server to bid.`,

    AUCTION_2: {
        HEADING: "Phase 2 – Founders Sale: Starting March 19th during auction ",
        CONTENT: `At the start of the auction, the minting of the Founders NFTs will go live. THESE ARE A SPECIAL RUN OF PREMIUM NFTS AND WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE!!! If you’re interested in the price of normal land, skip to Phase 3. Founders NFTs will sell for $150. In addition to being a special limited run of 100, there are some great perks:\n
    \n1. Each Founders NFT will be assigned to a special one chunk block in the Founders Courtyard. Each chunk has a special monument created by the Elite Realism team. The monuments commemorate the founding player and will act as a central focal point for the server. 
    \n2. Founders NFT owners will receive all future Premium Perks that are developed over time. 
    \n3. Beta access to future code improvements. New features to the ZerpCraft Plugin will be available to Founders NFT holders first. Additionally, the conversion path to XLS-20 will be made available first to Founders NFT holders. 
    \n4. Future minting fees are waived. Minting fees will be very small for all customers. However If you are a buyer who is interested in buying larger sections of land that may be divided and resold into smaller plots in the future, a Founders NFT may be of interest. Dividing up sections of land into smaller plots will be free for Founders NFT holders because the minting fee will be waived.`,

    AUCTION_3: {
        HEADING: "Phase 3 – Open Land Sale: Starting Monday March 21st – Closing April 11th ",
        CONTENT: `This is the main event! The ZerpCraft server will make land available to the general public for a 3 week period following the Auction. Land will be sold in 1 chunk increments. A ‘chunk’ is Minecraft jargon for a 16×16 block. However ZerpCraft NFTs will give you ownership rights of all the earth below and all the sky above.
        \nThe main issuance of ZerpCraft NFTs are designed to be cheap. One chunk of land will cost 1 XRP. This should enable players to purchase a wide range of land sizes. If you just want to play around with a cutting edge implementation of digital property rights, buy one chunk. If you’re a builder looking to make large builds, a sizable area of ZerpCraft real estate should not be out of reach.
        \nZerpCraft Server land is only available for purchase during Open Land Sales. These time limited sale periods are established to limit the total size of the ZerpCraft Server. The next Open Land Sale will be announced several months from now near the launch of XLS-20d. This means if you want to get in on some undeveloped land you need to be ready to buy during this launch window! `,

export const ABOUT_ZERPCRAFT = {
    FIRST_NFT: `<strong>ZerpCraft</strong> is one of the first NFT gaming applications built on the XRP Ledger. The ZerpCraft plugin creates a bridge between the XRPL and Minecraft (Java Edition) that allows for digital land ownership. Owners of a ZerpCraft NFT own a purchased section of land on a Minecraft multiplayer server. ZerpCraft at it’s core is an attempt to show the value of digital ownership via NFTs are well as virtual property rights.`,
    XLS_19:`Launching on the XLS-19 standard, ZerpCraft will first be available on a community server run by the project. Later (hopefully) in 2022, the project will migrate to the XLS-20 standard. The migration will include many enhancements to digital property rights, including the ability to buy/sell ZerpCraft NFTs on a marketplace or directly on the DEX.`,
    AFTER_LAUNCH:"After the launch of XLS-20, the ZerpCraft plugin will be made open source allowing any Minecraft server administrator the ability to mint ZerpCraft NFTs and monetize their server’s land. The ZerpCraft project is the proud recipient of a RippleX Development Grant! We are thankful for the faith that the Board has put in the project and are excited to deliver a cutting edge example of digital property rights on the XRPL. "
